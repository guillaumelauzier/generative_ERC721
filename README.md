# generative_ERC721

Here is an example of how you could implement a Generative ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language

In this code, the GenerativeERC721 contract extends the ERC721 contract from the OpenZeppelin library. It defines a seed variable that is used to initialize a random number generator, and a generateTokenId function that uses the random seed and a mathematical formula to generate a unique token ID for each new token.

The mint function is overridden to use the generateTokenId function to generate a unique token ID for each new token, instead of using the tokenId argument provided by the caller. This ensures that each token minted by the GenerativeERC721 contract has a unique ID, even if multiple tokens are minted with the same tokenId argument.

This is just one possible way to implement a Generative ERC-721 token. There are many other ways to generate unique token IDs, and you can modify the code to suit your specific needs and requirements.
